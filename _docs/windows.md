<center>You are the one girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you
</center>

<center>We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in the front yard
We got questions we should not ask but</center>

<center>How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too</center>

<center>In the summer, as the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you
We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms round you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon</center>

<center>How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too</center>

Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too</center>
